A thick ribbon of blood runs from her nose.

Finally, the damp, mildewed walls of a water well come into
focus.

an illustration of a little girl dancing with several
fairies flying around her.
At her side, a small pile of similar books in a book strap.

so many books, Ofelia.

text: Ofelia walks alongside the road, moving into the woods and
further away from the caravan of cars.
CAMERA surveys the heavy forest: a tangled tapestry of moss
and fog. The trees, swayed by the wind, murmur softly around Ofelia.
She stumbles upon a strange stone by the side of the road.
Roughly the size of a fist- carved on it, the outline of a
human EYE.
Fascinated, the young girl picks it up.
She looks around and finds -amidst the shrubs- an ancient
stone monolith incised with Celtic lettering.
It's crowned with the grotesque face of a satyr- mouth open
wide.
A piece of the brutish face is missing: an eye.
Ofelia fits the piece of engraved stone in the missing area.
A perfect fit.
From inside the statue a clicking noise emerges. The wind
picks up and out of the satyr's open mouth, a STICK INSECT lazily crawls
out. Ofelia smiles. The insect climbs atop the stone head
and studies the girl for a moment. Then

speaker_heading: CARMEN

dialog: Ofelia??

off. Ofelia runs to her mother's side.

darling. You have no idea-
So, I want you to call him ""Father."" Do
you hear me? ""Father...""
It's just a word, Ofelia.

as Mother and daughter climb into the main car and head off.
A beat later, the Stick Insect flies after them.

A gloved THUMB snaps the cover shut. A VOICE - CAPTAIN VIDAL

speaker_heading: VIDAL

dialog: Fifteen minutes late.

text: ANGLE WIDENS to describe a dilapidated WATER MILL.
The site consists of a pair of dark stone buildings with
corrugated roofs, connected to the mill by a small stone
bridge. A large water wheel hangs over the dry riverbed.
The wooden beams and columns bear sculpted Celtic motifs and
here and there, small, odd, carved creatures.
The walls have been reinforced with hundreds of sand-bags
and wooden pontoons, as if preparing for an attack.
CAPTAIN VIDAL and a small group of SERVANTS and SOLDIERS
wait patiently outside.

dialog: Captain!! They're here-

text: The caravan of Bentleys stops in front of the building. Vidal
and his group moves in. Servants and Soldiers unload luggage

but strict country woman.
Vidal greets Carmen.

dialog: Carmen- Welcome-

then points at a wooden wheelchair pushed to Carmen's side
by a small, nervous man SGT. GARCES. By his side stands

her books close to her chest.

dialog: Ofelia. Greet the Captain.

text:  She is wheeled away. An awkward silence passes between the
young girl and the Captain.

her left hand.

-a pile of sandbags. Perched on top-
-the big Stick Insect.
It fans out its multiple wings. Twice. Ofelia runs over and
tries to catch it.
But the Stick Insect takes off and escapes. The girl drops her
books and goes after it.

She follows it with her eyes and sees, about 100 meters
away, surrounded by trees, the ruins of a garden LABYRINTH.
The CAMERA glides up for a better view. The labyrinth is
circular, its paths overgrown and partially blocked.
Ofelia enters the labyrinth through an archway. She ventures
down one of its pathways and stops-

books in hand.

the mill. Better you don't go near it-

Looks back at the metronome. Still beeping away. He turns it off.

               starts off and Oliver falls into step behind him. They pass a
               sentry who salutes. Only the lighted lantern can be seen as
               they go into the darkness.

"
33,4,1,"scene_heading: EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT

text:  The CAMERA in SET UP TO SHOOT PAST the heaped-up dead. The
               only illumination is the lantern which Oliver carries, he and
               the General pick their way between the dead.
               ANOTHER ASPECT of the battlefield - an ox cart loaded with
               the dead, some of them tied to the rear axle by their naked
               legs. Two men, in the hooded coats worn by the infantry of
               the Balkan allies, are busy loading the cart. They look up,
               astonished, as the General and Oliver pass.
               STILL ANOTHER ASPECT of the battlefield  the General pauses
               as if to search out his way and then starts off determinedly
               toward the left. Oliver takes two long strides to catch up
               with him. The CAMERA DOLLIES WITH them. Oliver lifts the
               lantern and gestures outward with it."
