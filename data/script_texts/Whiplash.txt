scene_heading: INT. NASSAU BAND REHEARSAL STUDIO - GEHRING HALL - NIGHT 1

text: A cavernous space. Sound-proofed walls. And in the center, a
DRUM SET. Seated at it, in a sweat-marked white T, eyes
zeroed on his single-stroke roll, is ANDREW NEIMAN.
He’s 19, slight, honors-student-skinny -- except for his
arms, which have been built from years and years of drumming.
Suddenly -- a MAN enters the practice room. Stopping, rising--

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: Sorry... I’m -- I’m sorry--

speaker_heading: MAN

dialog: It’s ok. Stay there.
The MAN steps forward, removes his coat. He’s tall. Late
fifties. Black T-shirt, black slacks, black shoes. We’1ll know
him as FLETCHER.
The room is silent now. And then, softly, as he’s one of
those people whose whisper can scare the crap out of you--

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

dialog: What’s your name?

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: Andrew Neiman, sir.

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

dialog: What year are you?

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: I’m a first-year, sir.

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

dialog: You know who I am?

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: Yes...

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

dialog: You know what I do?

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: Yes...

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

dialog: So you know I’m looking for players.

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: Yes...

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

dialog: Then why did you stop playing?

text: Beat. Andrew nods, smiles. He gets it. Summons up all his
remaining energy and resumes playing, trying to really show
off this time. Rolls, fills, speedy stick-work. He finishes.

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

dialog: Did I say to start playing again?

text: Andrew looks at him.

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: I thought--
(then, blanching, )
I’m sorry, I misun--

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

dialog: I asked you why you stopped playing. Your
version of an answer was to turn into a
wind-up drummer monkey.

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: I’m sorry -- I--I stopped playing becau--

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

dialog: Show me your rudiments.

text: Andrew nods. Plays one rudiment after another: double-stroke
roll, paradiddle, ratamacue, flam, flamadiddle.

speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)

dialog: Uh-huh. Double-time swing.

text: Fletcher begins clapping his hand in time. Fast. Andrew plays.

speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)

dialog: No. Double-time. Double it. Bop-bop-bop-
bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop.

text: Andrew tries doubling the tempo. But he can’t. Fletcher STOPS
CLAPPING. The sign of death.

Andrew keeps playing, eyes shut... Then -- he hears the door
CLOSE. He stops, and looks up. Fletcher has left the room.
A moment later -- the door OPENS. It’s Fletcher. Andrew's
eyes widen. Maybe it’s not over...

speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)

dialog: Woopsy-daisy. Forgot my coat.

text: Fletcher grabs it, steps back out, CLOSES the door. Andrew
stares ahead, alone again at the drums -- and totally
deflated.
It’s over.
WIDE SHOT of the band room as Andrew slowly rises.

scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK STREET - SHAFFER CONSERVATORY - NIGHT 2

text: Andrew exits, hurries off. Pasted onto his overloaded back-
pack are patches, buttons, names: Krupa. Roach. Buddy Rich...
The buildings of midtown New York loom over him like giants --
immense, forbidding...

scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER - LOBBY - NIGHT 3

text: A quiet two-screen theater. Andrew buys concessions. The GIRL
at the counter is about his age. She’s pretty, but doesn’t
really know it. More to the point, she doesn’t seem to care.
Her name is NICOLE.

speaker_heading: NICOLE

dialog: Swedish fish?

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: Nah, not this time, thanks...

text: Andrew and Nicole exchange smiles. He takes his items --
popcorn, Raisinets, two sodas -- and heads off. Peers back at
Nicole. She’s staring into space. She looks suddenly lonely.
Andrew takes in the sight. You can tell he’s attracted to her
-- but he’s too nervous to do anything. A beat later, he
enters the theater.


scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER - MOMENTS LATER 4

text: Andrew spots a 53-year-old man seated near the front. This is

his dad -- JIM. Mild-mannered, soft-spoken, average in every
respect. Has the eyes of a former dreamer.
A smile between the two of them. Andrew hands his dad the
Raisinets, hands him the drink. Routine. The movie hasn’t
started yet. As they exchange items--

speaker_heading: JIM

dialog: You ok?

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: Sure...
A beat.

speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)

dialog: He had me play today.

speaker_heading: JIM

dialog: Andrew shrugs. It’s clear what that means.

speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)

dialog: You still have other options.

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: What do you mean?

speaker_heading: JIM

dialog: It’s good to be open-minded. When I was
your age I thought I’d have a book deal
at 23. Then that changed to 30. Then 40.

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: Right... And that didn’t upset you?

text: Jim shrugs, keeps his eyes down. He has a tendency to look
down when talking. The lights dim. The previews begin.

speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)

dialog: I mean, it has to do something to you.

speaker_heading: JIM

dialog: JIM
(another shrug)
I don’t know. Why? It’s just life.
(pause)
There's other things to care about.
Friends. Romance...

text: Andrew takes it in. Especially the last part.

speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)

dialog: At my age you get perspective.

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: I don’t want perspective.

text: Jim smiles. A moment.
Just then a MOVIEGOER squeezes into the row to head to a
seat further down -- and bumps against Jim and his bucket
of popcorn.

speaker_heading: JIM NEYMAN

dialog: Sorry.

text: The Moviegoer doesn’t say a word. Andrew watches. Takes
it in.

scene_heading: INT. DORMITORY - HALLWAY - HOURS LATER 6

text: Rusty elevator doors squeak open. Andrew steps out -- into a
grimy, green-walled hallway.
Dim lights, loud MUSIC blaring from behind a door. A thudding
party beat...
At the end of the hall -- where the music is coming from -- a
few PARTYGOERS mingle by a door. The door opens. A YOUNG MAN
hands a SECOND YOUNG MAN a wad of cash in exchange for a Zip-
lock bag of PILLS. The SECOND YOUNG MAN eyes Andrew.
Andrew turns away, heads left -- to his own door. Hurriedly
opens it and slips inside.

scene_heading: INT. DORMITORY - ANDREW’S ROOM - NIGHT 7

text: A single. Drumsticks and drum pads scattered, biographies of
Bach and Coltrane on the shelf, posters of Louis Armstrong
and Charlie Parker on the walls. A TV is on, some sort of
music documentary. Andrew watches from his bed -- as, over
OLD AUDIO OF DRUMMING and old stills of a boy at a drum set --

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)

dialog: By the age of ten, Traps the Boy Wonder
was wowing crowds all over America. By
his teens, Buddy Rich was well on his way
to becoming the stuff of legend.

speaker_heading: TALKING HEAD #1

dialog: Like any truly great player, Buddy seemed
to have been born with music in his
blood. He grasped it intuitively, ina
way you and I just can't.

speaker_heading: TALKING HEAD #2

dialog: You check out the old stuff, man. You look
at those movies when he was a kid, his
arms...

text: Beat. Andrew takes it all in -- especially these words:

speaker_heading: TALKING HEAD #2 (0.S.) (CONT’D)

dialog: You just can't teach that. That kind of
genius.
(pause)
You either got it or you don't.

text: Andrew turns off the TV. We hear the party beat continuing
outside, muffled. He leans back and switches off his light.

scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - NASSAU BAND ROOM - DAY 8

text: The same room we saw Andrew practicing in at night -- only now
it’s full of musicians. Mostly male, mostly first- and second-
years. This is NASSAU BAND, one of Shaffer’s lower-level jazz
ensembles. Because it’s Shaffer, the players are still first-
rate. A few third-years are here, too -- including a red-head
drummer with the body of a linebacker. RYAN CONNOLLY.
Andrew looks up -- in time to see Ryan with a GIRL by the
doorway. Ryan’s girlfriend is gorgeous -- tall, all curves.
Ryan lets his hand slide down her shoulder. Andrew watches...
The GIRL waves bye to Ryan as he heads in. He’s all macho
confidence.

speaker_heading: TRUMPETER

dialog: My man Ry! Shit, how you feeling?

speaker_heading: RYAN

dialog: Stitched up at last, dude.

speaker_heading: TRUMPETER

dialog: Things were hurting with Neiman on the kit--

text: Ryan taps him to stop. Andrew is within earshot -- and has
heard. Beat. Ryan moves over to Andrew, sits down at the set.

speaker_heading: RYAN

dialog: You have a good weekend, bro?

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: Yeah. Definitely. Really good.

speaker_heading: RYAN

dialog: Don’t worry about Greg. He’s a dick.

text: Andrew nods. Admires Ryan. Seems more diminutive now than ever.

speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)

dialog: You been practicing?

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: Yeah. All the time.

speaker_heading: RYAN

dialog: My man.

text: Then -- the Nassau Band conductor appears: RON KRAMER.

speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER

dialog: Morning, fellas. “Billie’s In”, bar 8.

text: Mr. Kramer CLAPS OFF in time -- and the band begins playing
FIRST NASSAU BAND REHEARSAL CHART. Mid-tempo. Ryan’s
confident, in control. Andrew turns his pages, watches...

speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER (CONT’D)

dialog: Nice, Ryan... Woah, trumpets.

speaker_heading: TRUMPETER #2

dialog: Yeah, yeah - sorry about that one.

speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER

dialog: Just brass again.

text: To Ryan’s left, a whisper--

speaker_heading: TRUMPETER

dialog: Ry...

text: Ryan turns. Visible as a silhouette through the frosted glass
of the main door...is FLETCHER. Andrew turns and looks as
well. Tenses up.
Fletcher lingers outside. Then he walks on. Ryan turns back to the Trumpeter.

speaker_heading: RYAN

dialog: Not today.

scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - NASSAU BAND ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 9

text: Rehearsal has ended. The MUSICIANS have just filed out --
except for Andrew, who’s hanging back...

speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER

dialog: Are you learning from Ryan?

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: Yeah... He’s been great to me.

speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER

dialog: Last week was a little overwhelming for you?

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: (is that a question?)
Yeah...
(then, hesitant, )
I wonder...what you think about my progress?

speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER

dialog: Your progress?

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: I just... I’m...practicing hard and...

speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER

dialog: Andrew -- you’ve got a good attitude. You
always arrive on time.

text: Andrew nods. Waiting.

speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER (CONT’D)

dialog: Yeah. Ok?

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: (beat)
Ok... Do you think... I know Fletcher's
looking for players...for Studio Band...

speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER

dialog: Yeah, Andrew... Lincoln Center looks out
for Fletcher's top players. If it weren’t
for Ryan’s injury he’d have been in Studio
Band last year. He’s a natural player.

text: Andrew takes this in. Nods.
A beat.

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: ok.

speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER

dialog: (this is awkward)
Look... I’m going to be candid. 90% of
our players will never make it into the
Lincoln Centers or the Collectives. The
question is -- who’s in that 10%?

speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER (CONT’D)

dialog: So I'd practice. You could start a rock
band.

text: Andrew takes it in. The implication is clear.
He turns -- and glimpses a poster on the wall: a DRUMMER
throwing a stick in the air mid-solo. Buff. Confident. The
opposite of him.

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: I...I have one more question...
(Kramer looks at him)
.-..Do you know what the process for
transferring is?

scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - BASEMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 11

text: Andrew walks down a hallway. A piece of paper in his hand.
It’s a TRANSFER APPLICATION...
He notices as two attractive female students pass him.

speaker_heading: STUDENT #1

dialog: At least you didn’t embarrass yourself like what’s-his-face.

speaker_heading: STUDENT #2

dialog: That was truly pathetic.

text: As he continues walking, he hears music. Stops. Approaches.

scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - STUDIO BAND ROOM - CONTINUOUS 11A

text: Through the pane of glass, Andrew can see a FULL ORCHESTRA.
Everyone looks older than in Nassau. More focused. All eyes
glued on Fletcher as he assumes his position...
Fletcher’s right arm moves, just a hair, and the band starts:
fast, dazzling. Andrew watches -- in awe. The band’s playing
STUDIO BAND EAVESDROP CHART, and the sound is so full, so
precise, so commanding. Nothing like Nassau.
And suddenly -- Fletcher TURNS AROUND. His eyes meet Andrew’s.
Andrew ducks out of view -- shit --
-- and hurries away.

scene_heading: INT. ANDREW'S PRACTICE ROOM - A FEW HOURS LATER 12

text: Andrew practices like mad, trying to nail a double-time swing.
To his left a digital METRONOME blinks. The time set: 380.
Andrew stops. Resets the metronome. 390. Resumes playing.
Tries to keep up. Resets the metronome to 400. Can’t keep up
at all now. Struggling, sweating, hands blistering, when --
CRAAACK. Andrew's right drumstick SNAPS IN HALF.
He stops. Spent. Looks at his hand, sweating and throbbing from
the blisters.
Looks back at the metronome. Still beeping away. He turns it off.
Glances up ahead at a poster -- of BUDDY RICH hunched over a drum kit, mid-solo -- tacked to the wall.
Stares at the image. Then looks down -- at the PAPERWORK we
saw earlier. 

scene_heading: INT. ANDREW’S PRACTICE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 12A

text: A CD slides into a player. The title: “BUDDY RICH: BIRDLAND”.
Andrew skips ahead to the third track. Immediately, drums
start. Another double-time swing. Only this one is insanely
fast. Even faster than Andrew was going.
Andrew listens. Looks at his drum kit. Thinks. Makes a decision.
Turns the CD off.

scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER - LOBBY - AFTERNOON 13

text: The same movie theater as before. Andrew marches in. Has one
goal and one goal only now.
Walks up to Nicole at the counter. Takes a deep breath, and--

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: Hey -- look -- I -- I don’t know how to say this -- I see you in here all the time and -- I was just wondering --
(stops, collects himself, ) -- if you'd want to get a bite to eat with me.

text: Beat. Nicole just looks at him. Andrew can’t believe he said what
he just said. Feels like a creep. Instantly regrets it.

speaker_heading: NICOLE

dialog: Please get away from me.

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: I’m so sorry, I -- I didn’t mea--

speaker_heading: NICOLE

dialog: I’m kidding.

text: She smiles. Beat. Andrew manages a nervous laugh.

speaker_heading: NICOLE (CONT'D)

dialog: That your dad you always come in with?

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: (discombobulated, trying to keep up--)
Kind of bobs up and down when he walks?
That’s him.

speaker_heading: NICOLE

dialog: (laughs; then, )
Andrew, right? I’m Nicole.

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: Nice to meet you, Nicole...

speaker_heading: NICOLE

dialog: Monday I get off at seven.

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: Monday. Ok. Great. I’1ll be here Monday.

text: A moment -- an awkward silence -- then Andrew turns -- and,
in a daze, realizing what’s just happened, his spirits
suddenly starting to soar -- he glides off.
