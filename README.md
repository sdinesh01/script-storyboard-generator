# script-storyboard-generator

### Goal: Use natural language processing methologies to distill movie scripts into prompts to create AI generated storyboards

I would like to test the current capacity of AI image generators to assist creative workflows in film. Illustration and storyboarding is a crucial process in film and television pre-production and encompasses writing, blocking, FX, sound, and cinematographic design. The goal is to develop a workflow that can assist visual artists with preliminary design.

Task challenges:
1. Writing scripts to standardize, distill, and meaningfully extract information from compositionally rigid documents (movie scripts)
2. Composing prompts for AI generators that maximize efficiency and accuracy (using MidJourney, Stable Diffusion, etc.)
3. (Optional) Analyze scripts to select a genre-appropriate illustration style for storyboard generation

Initial coding challenges: 
1. Creating a corpus of movie scripts (usually available online in PDF formatting)
2. Identifying key elements of a screenplay (scene headings, action descriptions, shots/transitions) 
3. Standardizing text formatting across different documents, varied writing styles, and genres
3. Associating characters with actions, characters with other characters, and characters in relation to the setting
